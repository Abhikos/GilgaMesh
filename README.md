###Setup
Note: Currently the setup system only works for Mac OS but we would like to host a tested setup script for other environments! Please consider contributing to help us do so.

To quickly setup the workspace, run:
```
./setup.sh
```

###Shortcuts
There are a few useful shortcuts made available in the .shortcuts file. If you would like to use them, run:
```
source .shortcuts
```
